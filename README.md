Project Title: Bizarre Cravings

The idea is to create an app which shows the list of all the weird and strange things eaten by different people.

Features:
1. The app will allow users to view and explore a collection of unusual and unique things eaten by people from all over the world, as listed by other users.
2. Each item  will be accompanied by an image of the person who consumed it, as well as a brief description or background information about the food or the individual. 
3. Users will also be able to browse through different lists of bizarre items eaten curated by other users.
